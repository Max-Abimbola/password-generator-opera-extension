# password-generator-opera-extension

## What was my motivation?
Honestly...
1. I was reusing too many passwords
2. They weren't all very secure
3. I kept forgetting them

So I looked online to find some "secure password generators" then realised I could basically just do it myself and practice my web dev skills.

## Why did I build this project?
I specifically chose to make a browser extension because I liked the idea of just being able to click a little icon and make a new password. 

This stops me (and any users) from having to open google and find a random password generator.

Of course password managers like dashlane and even google have tools to generate a strong password for you automatically, but just forget you saw them. 
 
To be fair, I only really saw google "suggest a strong password" when I was resetting my own google password (or a password for a website I can "sign into with google") so my idea isn't completely useless.
## What problem does it solve?
It allows you to quickly make a secure password
## What did I learn?
I learnt how to make opera extensions and as a consequence extensions for modern browsers which I've always been quite curious about
## What makes my project stand out?
Nothing much other than it has a nice slider (which I stole... Creator has been credited!)

# Project Descritption

## What my application does,
My application is an opera extension that generates a random string of characters of varying size. These can then be used as a password.
## Why you used the technologies you used,
Like I said before, I always wanted to see how browser extensions worked, but seperate to that, having the app as an extension is a lot more practical. 

If I was signing up for a website on my PC all I have to do is click a button and I have a secure password.

## Challenges and future features
<br>

### Challenges

A more major issue was the fact that I couldn't run certain javascript functions without setting certain permissions in the "manifest.json" file. This took a while but I resolved it pretty quickly

The project wasn't crazy challenging though, the main difficulty came with integrating different DOM events like buttons clicks and checkboxes.

### Future features

In the future I would love to extend the project to a full-blown password management system with storage, encryption etc that would be very cool. This would include some backend development which I haven't done a lot of so that would be fun.

More short term I'd like to "pretty" it up a bit more, since certain parts of it look a bit ugly (the checkboxes) I'd use CSS to do this.

I'd also like to make it easier to copy and paste the generated password to your clipboard. For example just having to click on the text area and have the password copied to your clipboard. That should be fairly easy to implement ,but I'm busy at the moment.

# How to use

You'll have to download the program files then follow the steps here:

https://dev.opera.com/extensions/basics/#:~:text=file%2C%20as%20follows%3A-,Go%20to%20the%20browser%20address%20bar%20and%20type%20opera%3Aextensions,the%20directory%20of%20your%20extension 

Thats just for now since for whatever reason opera won't let me publish the extension.

# Conclusion
Quite a small project but I'm proud of myself for being able to finish it so quickly.

I think my knowledge of webdev technologies is finally all coming togetgher.
 
I'll be updating this project for sure, but more exciting stuff to come!
